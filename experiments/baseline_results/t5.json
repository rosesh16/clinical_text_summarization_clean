ACS serves as catalyst for improved GDMT adherence in HF patients with CAD and DM. higher adherence is strongly associated with reduced rehospitalization and mortality."

ARNI-based triple therapy was associated with a significantly increased risk of hypotension. the safety profiles differ significantly, particularly regarding hypotension risk. the choice of regimen should be individualized based on patient priorities, comorbidities, and safety tolerability profiles."
