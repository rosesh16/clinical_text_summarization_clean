    "summary": "Evidence for the net benefit of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is finely balanced, leading to variation in guideline recommendations internationally. External validity of randomised clinical trial (RCT) evidence may therefore be of particular importance. The aim of this study is to characterise real-world patients according to their eligibility for guideline-cited aspirin RCTs for primary CVD prevention. Eligibility criteria from 14 RCTS were applied to a linked primary care/hospital discharge dataset of people \u2265 40 years without CVD. Proportions eligible for each trial were calculated, and characteristics of eligible and ineligible patients compared for each Trial, including Cox regression analysis of event rates for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), major bleeding events, and non-cardiovascular mortality. Of 570,211 included patients (300,500 [52.7%] women, 336,877 [59%] < 60 years), the median proportion ineligible for each RCT was 90.7%"

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have emerged as effective weight loss agents, with growing evidence suggesting potential benefits in MASH. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GLP- 1RAs in improving the histologic features of MASH, including balloon degeneration, lobular inflammation, and steatosis, compared with placebo. Results of this study are summarized in Table 1. The primary outcomes of the study were MASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis and \u22651-stage fibrosis at 12-18 months. Secondary outcomes included MASH without worsening in fibrosis stage, changes in the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score and changes in liver histologic feature, and the incidence of serious adverse events.

Modifiable lifestyle factors, particularly diet, may play a key role in renal health. This study aimed to investigate the association between diet quality, assessed by the Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015), and kidney function in a large sample of Iranian adults from the general population. This cross-sectional analysis used baseline data from the Ravansar Non-Communicable Diseases (RaNCD) cohort study, involving 8,787 adults aged 35-65 years. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), and diet quality was calculated using the HEI- 2015.

    "summary": "Influenza infection is a well-established trigger of severe respiratory and cardiovascular complications, particularly in older adults, frail individuals, and patients with underlying cardiovascular disease. Seasonal peaks are consistently associated with excess hospitalizations and mortality. Epidemiological studies have shown sharp increases in acute cardiac events during and immediately after influenza infection, including a high-rate of acute coronary syndromes and heart failure. The cardiovascular impact of influenza is mediated by multiple mechanisms. Systemic inflammation, plaque destabilization, metabolic imbalance, endothelial dysfunction, and pro-thrombotic activation collectively contribute to acute coronary Syndromes, myocarditis, arrhythmias, and acute or worsening heart failure in elderly and high-risk individuals. Despite the availability of effective and inexpensive vaccines, influenza vaccination remains underused in low-risk cardiovascular populations.
