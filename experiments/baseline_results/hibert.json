These findings support their early and integrated use, positioning SGLT2i as a cornerstone in the contemporary management of heart failure. Evidence suggests that SGLT2i may reduce chronic diuretic requirements, improve renal function, and provide additional cardiovascular protection."

Randomized trials and meta-analyses consistently support vaccination as a powerful preventive tool, associated with a 25-37% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality, with benefits comparable to established cardioprotective therapies. Systemic inflammation, plaque destabilization, metabolic imbalance, endothelial dysfunction, and pro-thrombotic activation collectively contribute to acute coronary syndromes, myocarditis, arrhythmias, and acute or worsening heart failure."
