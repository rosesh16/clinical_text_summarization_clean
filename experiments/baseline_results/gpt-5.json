    "summary": "This study assessed the external validity of aspirin randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease by applying eligibility criteria from 14 guideline-cited RCTs to a real-world dataset of adults aged ≥40 years without CVD. Eligibility proportions and differences in cardiovascular events, major bleeding, and non-cardiovascular mortality were analyzed. Among 570,211 patients, the median proportion ineligible for each RCT was 90.7%, indicating limited applicability of trial evidence to real-world populations."

    "summary": "This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in improving histologic features of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) compared with placebo. Primary outcomes were MASH resolution without worsening fibrosis and at least one-stage fibrosis improvement at 12–18 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in fibrosis stage, disease activity scores, liver histology, and serious adverse events."

    "summary": "This study evaluated the accuracy of phosphatidylethanol (PEth) as a biomarker for detecting heavy drinking in individuals with alcohol use disorder. Data from a 26-week randomized placebo-controlled trial of 127 participants were analyzed. PEth levels were compared with self-reported alcohol consumption, and correlations were assessed over multiple time windows to determine optimal cutoff values using ROC analysis."

    "summary": "This study reports long-term outcomes from the FAME 2 trial comparing fractional flow reserve–guided percutaneous coronary intervention plus medical therapy versus medical therapy alone in patients with stable coronary artery disease. Among 748 patients followed long term, FFR-guided PCI reduced the composite outcome of death, myocardial infarction, or urgent revascularization, primarily due to fewer urgent revascularizations."

    "summary": "This review describes the role of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in the management of heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction. Evidence from randomized trials shows reductions in hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality, including in non-diabetic patients. The mechanisms and clinical considerations for combining SGLT2 inhibitors with diuretics are discussed."

    "summary": "This prospective observational study evaluated doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients with type 2 diabetes receiving dapagliflozin in addition to metformin. Sixty patients were enrolled and assessed using echocardiographic methods to examine potential cardioprotective effects of dapagliflozin during chemotherapy."
