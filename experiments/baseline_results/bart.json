    "summary": "Evidence for the net benefit of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is finely balanced, leading to variation in guideline recommendations internationally. External validity of randomised clinical trial (RCT) evidence may therefore be of particular importance. The aim of this study is to characterise real-world patients according to their eligibility for guideline-cited aspirin RCTs for primary CVD prevention. Eligibility criteria from 14 RCTS were applied to a linked primary care/hospital discharge dataset of people \u2265 40 years without CVD. Proportions eligible for each trial were On average, trial-ineligible populations were younger (median age trialineligible 57.8 vs trial-eligible 62.6 years, p = 0.008) and a lower proportion had hypertension (23.9% vs 50.9%, p =0.004), diabetes (6.4% vs 11.5%, p= 0.015), or a regular statin prescription (11.8% vs 26.7%, p [95%CI 0.24-0.36] to 11.42 [95% CI 9.91-13.17]). Compared with trial-ineligible populations within the same age and sex strata, RCTs recruited people of varying CVD risk but often excluded people at high risk of bleeding or non-CVD death, highlighting that many trials may overestimate the net benefit of aspirin for primary prevention."

    "summary": "Heart failure (HF) patients with concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) represent a particularly high-risk population with increased morbidity and mortality. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) often serves as a critical event that can trigger optimization of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT). However, the impact of ACS on long-term adherence patterns and outcomes in this population remains unclear. We retrospectively studied 431 patients with HF (LVEF \u2264 40%), CAD, CAD, and DM presenting with ACS between 2019 Primary outcomes were rehospitalization and all-cause mortality, analyzed using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier methods. Mean age was 62.1 \u00b1 10.2 years, and 64.7% were male. Before ACS, 45.9% had poor adherence and only 16.0% had good adherence. After ACS, poor adherence dropped to 7.9%, while good adherence rose to 62.2% (p < 0.001). Statin use increased from 22.3% to 82.4%, ACEi/ARB/ARNI from 58.2 Patients with good adherence had significantly lower risks of rehospitalization (HR 0.52) and mortality (HR0.46). Independent adverse outcome predictors were low hemoglobin, high HbA1c, impaired renal function, and reduced LVEF. ACS serves as a catalyst for improved GDMT adherence in HF patients with CAD and DM. Higher adherence is strongly associated with reduced re Hospitalization and mortality, underscoring the need for sustained adherence strategies and multidisciplinary care models to optimize long-term outcomes."

This study evaluated region-specific alterations in DAergic neurotransmission within the hippocampus, striatum, and prefrontal cortex, and their association with social behavioral deficits in diabetic mice.

Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to carry out expression analysis. STZ-induced diabetic mice showed normal sociability and social novelty preference but exhibited a marked decline in social recognition memory, indicating selective impairment of long-term social cognition.

Seasonal peaks are consistently associated with excess hospitalizations and mortality. Epidemiological studies have shown sharp increases in acute cardiac events during and immediately after influenza infection, including a high-rate of acute coronary syndromes and heart failure. The cardiovascular impact of influenza is mediated by multiple mechanisms. Systemic inflammation, plaque destabilization, metabolic imbalance, endothelial dysfunction, and pro-thrombotic activation collectively contribute to acute coronary Despite the availability of effective and inexpensive vaccines, influenza vaccination remains underused in high-risk cardiovascular populations.
