In clinical practice, their combination with diuretics requires careful titration to prevent hypovolemia, hypotension, and renal dysfunction, especially in frail elderly patients. Evidence suggests that SGLT 2i may reduce chronic diuretic requirements, improve renal function, and provide additional cardiovascular protection."

In this prospective observational study, a total of 60 newly diagnosed women with type 1 diabetes were enrolled. Within-group changes from baseline to 3 months were analyzed with paired t-tests. Between-group comparisons of 3-month outcomes and changes (\u0394LVEF, \u0394LVGLS, \u0394NT-proBNP) were also conducted using independent, randomized, and multivariable, non-invasive, and non-randomized (non-inclusive) methods. The favorable changes observed in LVEF ( LVGLS) and NT-proBP parameters suggest that Dapagllozin may be considered a potential cardirotective agent and incorporated into preventive strategies against chemotherapy-related cardiotoxic in diabetic patients. These hypothesis-generating findings require confirmation in larger randomized trials powered for clinical endpoints with longer follow-up.The favorable changes in LveF, LV"

Lorcaserin reduced total body weight (time*treatment, p = 0.004). Lorcasersin reduced abdominal fat mass (time-treated, p < 0.001). Adjusted delta and endpoint comparisons showed reductions in total body (p = 0 and 0.031) and abdominal fat (p > 0.002). These results support the hypothesis that reducing total body fat mass may improve cardiometabolic health primarily through reductions in central adiposity."

Systemic inflammation, plaque destabilization, metabolic imbalance, endothelial dysfunction, and pro-thrombotic activation collectively contribute to acute coronary syndromes, myocarditis, arrhythmias, and acute or worsening heart failure.

We conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing six treatment regimens. The safety profiles differ significantly, particularly regarding hypotension risk with ARNI and renal protection with SGLT 2i. The choice of regimen should be individualized based on patient priorities, comorbidities, and safety tolerability profiles. The data were obtained from six randomized controlled controlled trials and from six RCTs comparing six therapy regimens, with the safety profiles of ARNI, SGL T2i, and ARNI."
