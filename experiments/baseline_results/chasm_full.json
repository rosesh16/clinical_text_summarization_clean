[95%CI 0.24-0.36] to 11.42 Compared with trial-ineligible populations within the same age and sex strata, RCTs recruited people of varying CVD risk but often excluded people at high risk of bleeding or non-CVD death, highlighting that many trials may overestimate the net benefits of aspirin."

Secondary outcomes included \u22651-point improvements in the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score, changes in liver histologic features, and the incidence of serious adverse events. The pooled serious adverse event rate was comparable to placebo."

There were significant main effects of treatment on the number of falls per year of treatment, as well as on the dosage level (low, medium, or high) (p = 0.04) and number of fell during the six months prior to study entry (p < 0.001). Study fall rates extrapolated out to the total number of years of treatment for subgroups distinguished by dosage level and prior falls ranged from 1.39 falls/year (no history of falls, low dosage bupropION) to 12.32 falls/ year (3 + falls during the 6 months prior a study entry, high dosage bpropion)."
