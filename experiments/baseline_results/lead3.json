    "summary": "To compare the functional and anatomical outcomes of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with or without internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling in patients suffering with non-resolving vitreous hemorrhage and tractional retinal detachment. Fifty-seven patients (57 eyes) suffering from PDR were randomly assigned to undergo PPV with ILM peeling (n = 26) or without ILM peeling (n = 31). Outcomes assessed over a 6-month follow-up included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), need for additional anti-VEGF injections, frequency of reoperations, central macular thickness (CMT), development of epiretinal membrane (ERM), macular traction, and vascular parameters derived from OCT imaging."

    "summary": "There have been multiple attempts to identify biological factors that predict long-term weight change. Previous investigators have theorized that variations in how humans metabolize dietary macronutrients (storage as opposed to oxidation) might be one of these characteristics, but to date there has been no effort to address this hypothesis. We used a retrospective cohort study design to test the hypothesis that greater meal fat storage in subcutaneous adipose tissue would be associated with greater future weight gain."

Current evidence supports bariatric surgery and low-calorie diets with meal replacements. No clinical trial to date has evaluated plant-based dietary alternatives as an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) strategy, despite the emphasis on plant-based diets in current clinical practice guidelines for diabetes and cardiovascular disease."

In this retrospective cohort study, 92 DFU patients were assessed during a 6-month outcome evaluation period and categorized by ulcer healing into good prognosis (healed, n = 50) or poor prognosis (unhealed, n = 42). Serum APN and sICAM-1 levels were measured by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and and analyzed for correlations with disease severity and infection grades."

In sharp debridement, patients are expected to experience greater levels of pain because of cell damage. This study evaluated the effect of applying cold 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) during sharp debridement on pain in patients with diabetic foot."

Secondary analysis of a 10-year follow-up of an RCT with initially 113 patients (BMI 50-60 kg/m2) randomized to either standard (n = 57, 50 cm biliopancreatic/150 cm alimentary limb) or distal long alimentary limb RYGB (n = 56, 50 cm biliopancreatic/150 cm common limb) from March 2011 to April 2013 at two Norwegian hospitals."

Understanding the precise mechanisms by which lifestyle interventions prevent diabetes is crucial for optimizing clinical care. This study aimed to quantify the extent to which weight change mediates the observed 46% reduction in postpartum diabetes risk achieved by an intensive lifestyle intervention in women with prior GDM."

Populations presenting with wounds (such as trauma and ulcers) are typically heterogeneous, and often exhibit a range of comorbidities and secondary factors that influence both the nature of the lesion itself and the trajectory of wound healing. Typical comorbidities in patients with ulcers include diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and polypharmacy is common."
